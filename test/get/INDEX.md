# get/ — `be get` (checkout) integration cases

* `01-checkout/` — put + post + `be get '?'` on a fresh repo with one
  file (greet.txt = "hello world\n"); pins down post stderr shape and
  that GET succeeds against the just-committed branch tip.
* `02-single-file-overwrite/` — `be get file.c?feat` (VERBS.md §GET):
  fork ?feat with a different `lib.c`, switch back to trunk, then
  pull only `lib.c`'s feat-side blob into the wt.  Asserts the file
  bytes flip and `.sniff` does NOT grow (no staging — no `get` row).
